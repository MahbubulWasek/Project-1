## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Boston AirBnB dataset to better understand:

1. How has the price been changing for AirBnB homes in Boston?
2. Explore the relationship between price and various attributes?
3. What are some of the common features that customers take into consideration for a good experience?
4. Is it possible to predict the price by constructing a Linear Regression Model?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 datasets used here to provide the answers related to the above questions.  The raw files for each of the 3 datasets is provided in the repository.  Markdown cells were used in the notebook to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://mwase009.medium.com/can-we-guess-the-airbnb-home-prices-in-boston-2b1ce3a96c).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Udacity for the project learning.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
